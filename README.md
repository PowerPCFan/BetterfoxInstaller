# BetterfoxInstaller
A quick and easy way to install https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox user.js mods for Firefox. 

# Running the Script
- **Run Method 1 (recommended):** Open PowerShell <u>**as admin**</u> and then copy, paste, and run this quick command: `irm https://bit.ly/betterfoxinstaller | iex`
  - If you don't run as admin, it will attempt to elevate itself, but it will fail and close because it can't reopen the script since it doesn't exist on your PC (it's being run from GitHub)

- **Run Method 2:** Go to the "Releases" page on this GitHub repo and manually download and run the PowerShell script. 

# "This broke something, how do I fix it?!" 
This is not a problem with my script, so please do not create an issue in this repo. All this does is apply the Betterfox user.js tweaks.  

Consider checking out the page https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Common-Overrides from the developer of Betterfox. It explains how to revert certain changes.
