# BetterfoxInstaller
A quick and easy way to install https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox user.js mods for Firefox. 

# How to run
Go to the releases page: https://github.com/PowerPCFan/BetterfoxInstaller/releases
There is a .ps1 and a .exe you can choose from. I'd recommend the EXE if you don't know how to run PowerShell scripts. 

# "This broke something, how do I fix it?!" 
Please check out the page https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Common-Overrides from the developer. It gives you the lines to add to the user.js file to revert certain changes that Betterfox makes.
