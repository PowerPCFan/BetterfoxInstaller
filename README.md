# "This broke something in Firefox, how do I fix it??" 

This is not a problem with my script, it is most likely something that Betterfox changed, so please do not create an issue in this repository.  
Consider checking out the page https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox/wiki/Common-Overrides from the developer of Betterfox. It explains how to revert certain changes that may be unwanted by some.
