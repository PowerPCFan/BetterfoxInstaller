# BetterfoxInstaller
A quick and easy way to install https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox user.js mods for Firefox. 

# How to run
Go to the releases page: https://github.com/PowerPCFan/BetterfoxInstaller/releases
There is a .ps1 and a .exe you can choose from. I'd recommend the EXE if you don't know how to run PowerShell scripts.
